## Description

BoatDatLife is a blog made as my project exam in my first year as a Front-end development student. The blog posts are made in WordPress, and all the text on the blog is for now "Lorem ipsum" and so on. The focus on this project was to create a WordPress site, and collecting the data from there through a rest API-call. Everything on the blog that is not a blogpost is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, And every post, and then also the list of posts and the carousel on the frontpage, is coded in JavaScript, with the data comming from WordPress and the rest API.

You can add some bullet points if you'd like to:
